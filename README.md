The files available are PDF and Tableau Workbook file types of Tableau projects I completed about the traffic volume of Minnesota's interstate roads, and the call center efficiency at Google Fiber. 
The Minnesota Interstate Traffic data visualization attempts to show insights on finding the days that tend to have the least amount of traffic so that construction in the future can occur on those days, causing less burden to travelers. 
The Google Fiber Call Center visualization tries to demonstrate insights on what factors such as days of the week and geographic market are causing the most repeat calls (a repeat call is a customer call concerning a previous issue that has not been resolved by the team). 

Both were part of a Google Business Intelligence certificate with Coursera and the skills involved translate to many productive business positions (such as data analytics and business intelligence) and were also very fascinating to create and analyze!
