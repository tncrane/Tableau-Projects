The two files available are PDF and Tableau Workbook file types of a Tableau project I completed about the traffic volume of Minnesota's interstate roads. The data was primarily collected in order to find the days that tended to have the least amount of traffic so that 
construction could occur on those days, causing less burden to travelers. This was part of a Google Business Intelligence certificate with Coursera.
