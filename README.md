The files available are PDF and Tableau Workbook file types of Tableau projects I completed about the traffic volume of Minnesota's interstate roads, and the call center efficiency at Google Fiber. 
The Minnesota Interstate Traffic data visualization attempts to show insights on finding the days that tend to have the least amount of traffic so that construction in the future can occur on those days, causing less burden to travelers. 
The Google Fiber Call Center visualization tries to demonstrate insights on what factors need the most attention by company stakeholders in terms of their repeat call volume (when a customer has to call more than one time to have the same problem resolved). 

Both were part of a Google Business Intelligence certificate with Coursera and were quite fun to create and analyze!
